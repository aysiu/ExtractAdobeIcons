# ExtractAdobeIcons
Extracts icons from Adobe Creative Cloud .app bundles. It must be run on a Mac that has all the relevant Adobe CC .app bundles installed.

Extracted .png icons will be on the desktop of the user running the script. The names of the .png files will be based on the names Adobe has given the bundles, so you may have to rename the .png files to match the item names in your Munki repo (if you're using Munki).
